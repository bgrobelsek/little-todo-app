# Little todo app

Hello, my name is Bruno and welcome to the Little-Todo-App!

<p>
      This app is my University project
      it's built by using VueJS, Vuetify
      and Firebase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Todos are stored in Google Firestore database and are
      managed in realtime using query snapshots.
      You can add todos, "cross" them out when they are done
      and delete them. Next to the todo input field is a filter
      for the mentioned todos. On the left side of the app 
      there is a navigation drawer with navigation links. 
      Please note that this app is still in development
      so some things need more work and there are areas
      that could be improved with time or but the basic
      functionallity is there.
    </p>
    <p> The app is also suited for desktop / tablet / mobile phone use.</p>
